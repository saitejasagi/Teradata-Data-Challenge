**About**

The Taproot Foundation drives social change by leading, mobilizing, and engaging professionals in pro bono service. Essentially, they are helping nonprofits and social change organizations solve critical challenges in their communities with the support of skilled volunteers sharing their expertise pro bono. Nonprofits and social change organizations take on critical issues facing our communities every single day like homelessness, economic inequality, violence, civil rights, and more. However, they have limited access to the required resources such as marketing, technology, human resources, or funding (Taproot, 2020). Taproot acts as connectors to bring together these organizations with business professionals who volunteer their expertise pro bono. Through this unique collaboration, nonprofit professionals and skilled volunteers work together to build a strong infrastructure that supports the organization in achieving its mission. Up to now, Taproot has served 7,649 organizations and made 13,256 total number of engagements, delivering 1.7 million hours of services with a value of $204 million (Taproot, 2020).

**Business statements**

- Our analysis focuses on the four business questions as below:
1. Which project types produce the best outcomes in survey data?
2. How many sessions does a non-profit create before starting a project?
3. Which project types take the longest to complete? Shortest?
4. Average days to complete projects with multiple volunteers?

**Conclusion**

The studyâ€™s analysis findings expect to provide useful insights for the Taproot Foundation to better understand the effectiveness of their pro bono services with Taproot Plus projects and Taproot Plus sessions and to ensure that available resources are directed efficiently. Besides, identifying underperforming projects can also help the Foundation investigate the cause of the problem and determine if any actionable plan needs to be done in order to fix the issue and improve the project outcomes. This will help the Taproot Foundation further envision all organizations with promising solutions, enabling them to successfully take on urgent social challenges and deliver on their missions more efficiently and effectively.
